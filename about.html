    <p>Hi, I’m Adam. I write code, sometimes well. Welcome to my little slice of internet.</p>
    <p>I studied computer science at <a href="http://siue.edu">Southern Illinois University – Edwardsville</a> before going out to San Francisco to work as an engineering intern at <a href="http://rapleaf.com">Rapleaf</a>. I am currently a software developer working in the St. Louis area at <a href="http://juggle.com">Juggle, LLC</a>. We do much more than just aggregate reference information and our <a href="http://www.juggle.com/juggle-office" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.juggle.com']);">office is awesome</a> – you should apply.</p>
    <p>I have done extensive work with highly scalable back end Java and Ruby systems. I also have experience working with Hadoop and HDFS. Currently I work on integrating C#.NET applications with the Google, Bing, and Amazon Mechanical Turk APIs.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:coffman.adam@gmail.com">email me</a> for a resume or additional details.</p>
