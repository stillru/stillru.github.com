### SRE in startup

At LTD "Nebius" (formerly Yandex), I worked as an SRE Engineer, where my focus was on automating cloud systems and ensuring the reliability of complex infrastructures like Kubernetes. I deployed servers using Terraform and streamlined operations by automating Jira tasks.

I provided internal staff with technical support, created observability alerts to monitor system performance, and ensured the smooth functioning of the cloud environment. This role allowed me to combine automation and infrastructure management to enhance system efficiency and reliability.

My job was:

 - Cloud systems automation
 - Handling various tasks with complicated Systems (Kubernetes)
 - Deploying servers with Terraform
 - Automate Jira tasks
 - Provide support for internal staff
 - Create observability alerts
