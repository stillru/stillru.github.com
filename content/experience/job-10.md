### Work with pepole

As a Presales Engineer and Product Consultant at LTD "New Cloud Technologies" from January 2019 to April 2023, I worked closely with clients to ensure smooth product integration and deployment. My role involved setting up test environments, diagnosing potential issues early on, and offering technical support throughout the sales cycle. I specialized in understanding client needs, addressing unique requests, and providing tailored solutions.

I also conducted initial audits of clients' technology landscapes to create detailed profiles that helped guide the implementation process. Additionally, I advised clients on product integration through APIs and SDKs, ensuring seamless compatibility. A key part of my work was preparing thorough documentation for tenders, helping secure critical business opportunities. This role allowed me to combine my technical expertise with client-facing responsibilities, making a direct impact on the success of each project.

My job was:

 - Deployment of test benches and product environments
 - Advising clients on product functionality
 - Solving non-standard customer requests
 - Technical support of transactions
 - Primary diagnostics of failures at the stage of pre-sales deployment of solutions
 - Initial audit of the customer's technology landscape
 - Creation of technological profiles of the customer
 -  Advising on integration with products through the API/SDK of the product
 - Preparation of documentation for tenders
