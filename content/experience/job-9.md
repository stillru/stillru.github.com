### Field Engineer

At Megapolis Trading Company, after serving in a managerial role, I decided to return to a more hands-on, technical position. My responsibilities focused on providing comprehensive user support and managing the Panasonic telephone network. I also took charge of administering users within an Active Directory domain, ensuring smooth IT operations.

In addition to these tasks, I collaborated with contractors, handled procurement of equipment and consumables, and maintained detailed technical documentation. This role allowed me to stay directly involved in the day-to-day technical needs of the company while leveraging my organizational and technical skills.

My job was:

 - User support
 - Panasonic telephone network administration
 - Administering Users in an Active Directory Domain
 - Work with contractors
 - Procurement of equipment and consumables
 - Maintenance of technical documentation
