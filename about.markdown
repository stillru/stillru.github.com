Matt is an Internet Services Developer at <a href="http://netcraft.com">Netcraft</a>. He feels the need to stress that the opinions expressed here are his own.

He now has a PhD from the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk), UK, after surviving the examination process, and is very pleased that he graduated whilst still at the youthful age of 25. 

He lives with the lovely (Dr) [Charlie Beldon](http://charliebeldon.com), in the centre of Bath, surrounded by [pretty buildings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattfoster/sets/72157601599289776/ "Bath Stone: A Study - a set on Flickr"), and [parks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattfoster/sets/72157601823551359/ "Prior Park 2007 - a set on Flickr"). He'd like to live somewhere like this when he grows up.

In his spare time, which sometimes encroaches into work time, Matt likes to hack bits of code (usually Ruby, but sometimes shell code or C), break his website, [take photos](http://flickr.com/photos/mattfoster), play console games, [read books](http://www.librarything.com/catalog/mattfoster "LibraryThing | Catalog your books online") and watch sci-fi.

Generally Matt will be found [listening to music](http://www.last.fm/user/mattfoster), including a variety of metal and progressive rock, as well as some other things. At the moment, [Porcupine Tree](http://www.porcupinetree.com/ "Porcupine Tree - Official Website") is probably his favourite.

He doesn't normally talk about himself in the third person, but he stole the idea from [Charles Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/ "Charlie's Place"), [who did it better](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html "The Charles Stross FAQ").
